<center>The field of AI research was born at a workshop at college in 1956, where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy to differentiate the sphere from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist mathematician. Attendees Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT), Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders and leaders of AI research. They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing": computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954) (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the common human), solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking English. By the center of the 1960s, research within the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established round the world. </center>
