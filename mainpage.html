<center><p1>Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity, and are common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Capek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots). These characters and their fates raised many of the identical issues now discussed within the ethics of computer science.
The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of formal logic led on to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction.
This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is understood because the Church–Turing thesis. 
together with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, scientific theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to think about the likelihood of building an electronic brain. Turing proposed changing the question from whether a machine was intelligent, to "whether or not it's possible for machinery to point out intelligent behaviour".
the primary work that's now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons".</p1></center>
