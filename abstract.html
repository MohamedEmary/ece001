<center><p1>In applied science, AI sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
Leading AI textbooks define the sector because the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is commonly wont to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans go with the human mind, like "learning" and "problem solving".

As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to need "intelligence" are often off from the definition of AI, a phenomenon referred to as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.
" as an example, optical character recognition is often excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology. </p1></center>
